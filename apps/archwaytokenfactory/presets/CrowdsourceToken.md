## This piece of documentation aims to explain: 

1. Who your community is.
2. Your DAO’s purpose.
3. Whether the creation of a market is essential or not.


## Who is your community?

All-Stars List is an invite only, application based list of wallets you can use to airdrop your token to. It only includes members of the Solana community that earned their way into this list. No bots - no duplicates.

## What is the DAO going to be used for?

The community will use the DAO to allocate the crowdsourced funds. It will act as a platform where token holders will submit proposals related to various community initiatives, create polls and initiate discussion. Members can then vote on these proposals to determine which ones receive the community’s support. 

#### Notes:
- All proceeds from the options exercise will be deposited to the DAO.
- All unclaimed tokens will be deposited to the DAO for future distributions.
  

## Is creating a market essential for your token?

Market creation isn't deemed essential for this token. However, a succesfull token market launch can incentivize the option recipients to exercise.
