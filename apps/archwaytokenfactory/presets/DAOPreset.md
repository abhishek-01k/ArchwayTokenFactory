## This piece of documentation aims to explain: 

1. Your DAO’s purpose.
2. Whether the creation of a market is essential or not.

## What is the DAO going to be used for?

A “DAO” is a tokenized community where members with a shared interest get together to form an on-chain club. Whether your passion is Sailing whether it's Cryptocurrencies this is your way to create the most fair type of community human has invented. The DAO can be used as a Sandbox for thought and initiatives where members can submit proposals related to various community initiatives, create multiple choice polls and initiate public / on-chain discussion. Members can then vote on these proposals to determine which ones receive the community’s support.
  
## Is creating a market essential for your token?

The main reason behind bootstrapping a market for your token is to widen its distribution. Most often, token markets are created by the community when they want to exit that community or when they see more value trading their token for another currency/token. Therefore, due to this token's nature, ArchwayTokenFactory doesn't support Market Creation for this token.
