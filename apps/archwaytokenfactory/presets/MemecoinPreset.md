## This piece of documentation aims to explain: 

1. Identifying the optimal community for your token.
2. Your DAO’s purpose.
3. Utilizing your DAO’s token allocation.
4. Market Creation and token LP.

### Let’s start:

## How should you identify the optimal community for your token?

When launching a Memecoin you want to airdrop tokens to people that will add value to your community, just by being a part of it. Some of those people are:

- Bluechip NFT holders (SMB, Mad Lads, Degen Ape Academy, FFF, Galactic Geckos etc)
- Members of Impactful DAOs in the space (Dean’s List DAO, SuperteamDAO, MonkeDAO, Lamport DAO, BonkDAO, Dual DAO etc.)
- Memecoin holders (Holders of Bonk, Bern, OPOS, Cope etc.)
- Solana NFT artists
- Solana Developers
- Teams you have partnered with and teams that helped your project grow.
- Early Contributors to the Project

## What is the DAO going to be used for?

This DAO will serve as the on-chain town square for your memecoin's community. Its members will submit proposals related to various community initiatives, create polls and initiate discussion. Members can then vote on these proposals to determine which ones receive the community’s support.

## How to utilize the DAO’s token allocation?

- Pay for Community Management, DAO related work, DAO IRL initiatives etc. 
- Use it as a war chest for acquiring other assets. (Acquiring other assets can serve speculation, participation in other DAO’s governance, securing partnerships, etc)
- Use it to reward active DAO members who vote and create proposals in order to incentivize all token holders to participate in governance.

## Market Creation?

ArchwayTokenFactory supports a market creation function for this preset. The LP Token is transferred to the DAO's treasury.
