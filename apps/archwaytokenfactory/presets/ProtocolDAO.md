# Protocol DAO Preset

This DAO model is a low-risk and fair governance structure for decentralized protocols.

- Token Name: PROTOCOL
- Token Symbol: PRTC
- Token Suppy: 1.000.000
- Recipients: Team & DAO Treasury
- Team Allocation: 60%
- DAO Treasury Allocation: 40%
- Quorum: 30%
- Mint Authority: Burnt

## This piece of Documentation aims to explain:

1. The token's distribution
2. Proposed Governance Structure
3. Your DAO's purpose

   ### Token Distribution

Allocating 40% of the tokens to the treasury allows for further team expansion, as new members can receive Protocol "equity" in form of tokens, and leaves room for incentivizing existing members with more governance power.
- Possible KPIs you can use to calculate those emissions are Governance Participation and earnings since protocol inception. 
This Preset also distributes one council token per team member. The council tokens are to be used only for emergencies such as faster execution and to veto malicious proposals that may harm the protocol or its users.

  ### Governance Structure

- Proposal Creation Threshold: 10.000 Tokens
- Proposal Quorum: 30%
- Voting Time: 3 Days
- Council Membership Revokable by Community Vote: Yes

  ### What are the DAO's functions?

The DAO holds the Protocol's upgrade authority and the remaining token supply. Token holders will vote on proposals regarding Protocol Upgrades, Token Emissions, New member additions, Staking operations and possibly budgeting proposals.
The development funds are held in a multisig wallet where signers are selected team members. The DAO can use the protocol's revenues to pay out its members or buyback Tokens from the market and burn them, therefore increasing the members
holdings value.
